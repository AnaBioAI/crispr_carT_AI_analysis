# Systematic Discovery of CRISPR-Boosted CAR-T Cell Immunotherapies — Reproduction & Extension

This repository reproduces and extends the analysis from *Seki et al., Nature 2023*, integrating CRISPR functional genomics and single-cell RNA-seq to explore CAR-T activation mechanisms.

## Project Structure
## Goals
1. Reproduce key scRNA-seq visualizations and cluster annotations.
2. Train machine-learning models to classify CAR-T activation states.
3. Perform pathway enrichment to identify biological mechanisms of improved potency.

## Tools
Python, Scanpy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Seaborn, gseapy, JupyterLab.
